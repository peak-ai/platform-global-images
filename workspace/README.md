# Workspace
Workspaces provide users with a fully functional cloud development environment - one that has all the screws and bolts one might need to develop their Machine learning systems and that allows users to connect to Peak infrastructure super easily as well.

## Available Images
We provide Python and R versions of the images. Here are the images that are available:
- [Python](./python)
  - [ds-pack](./python/ds-pack)
    - [workspace-python-ds-pack-v1](./python/ds-pack/v1/)
