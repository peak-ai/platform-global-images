# Workflows
Workflows are the heart of any data processing pipeline that is created on the Peak platform. They are used to automate and visualize data processing tasks by creating a series of steps represented as a flowchart or graph.

## Available Images
We provide Python and R versions of the images. Here are the images that are available:
- [Python](./python)
  - [standard-pack](./python/standard-pack)
    - [workflow-python-standard-pack-v1](./python/standard-pack/v1)
  - [ds-pack](./python/ds-pack)
    - [workflow-python-ds-pack-v1](./python/ds-pack/v1/)
- [R](./r)
  - [standard-pack](./r/standard-pack)
    - [workflow-r-standard-pack-v1](./r/standard-pack/v1)
  - [ds-pack](./r/ds-pack)
    - [workflow-r-ds-pack-v1](./r/ds-pack/v1/) 

## Important
- Every workflow image must set up a non-root user. Details for the same can be found [here](../knowledge-base/non-root-user.md).
