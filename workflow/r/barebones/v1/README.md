# workflow-r-barebones-v1
This is the smallest R image that allows users to run workflows.

## Image Details
### Base Image
This image uses `r-base:4.2.0` as its base which is maintained by [the Rocker Community](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker).

### OS and other basic details
```
Debian         bookworm/sid
Linux Kernel   5.10.104-linuxkit
R              4.2.0
```

### Linux Packages Installed
```
aws-cli                 2.2.5
git                     2.35.1
redshift-odbc-driver    1.4.27.1000
snowflake-odbc-drive    2.24.4
```

### R Libraries Installed
```
odbc                    1.3.3
```

### Environment Variables
- `AMAZONREDSHIFTODBCINI`: This represents the location of `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini` file and is set to `/home/peak-user/redshift/amazon.redshiftodbc.ini` as we have added the file there.
- `ODBCSYSINI`: This represents the location of `odbcinst.ini` file and is set to `/home/peak-user` by default.

### ODBC Setup
- The `odbcinst.ini` file exists in the `/home/peak-user` directory, and the `ODBCSYSINI` env has been set accordingly.

### Build Arguments
The Dockerfile expects the following build arguments:
- `PEAK_USER_ID`: This is the default user that the workflow step runs with when this image is used in the Peak platform. On the Peak platform, this value must be `8877`. Inside the image we create a new user with this user id which is then used when running the image across various services in the Peak Platform.

## Building the Image
Building the image is quite straightforward, just run the docker build command passing in the required build arguments.
```
docker build . -t workflow-r-barebones-v1 -build-arg PEAK_USER_ID=8877
```

## Using the Image
- The image can be directly used by using it in the workflow step form.
- If you need to install a few more dependencies, or add some use case-specific environment variables into the image, the image can easily to extended.
