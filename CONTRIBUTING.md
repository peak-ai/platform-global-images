# Contributing to Peak Platform Global Images
Despite being primarily maintained by Peak, we welcome pull requests to this repo! We thank you for your time and efforts in making these images better üôåüèª

Please read our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before getting started.

## Contribution Guide
### Making the changes
- `Fork` this repository.
- Create a new branch, remember to give this branch a good name - something that explains its purpose.
- Make changes to your branch. Depending upon the nature of your change, please make sure to either create a new directory/version or change the existing files. If your change is a breaking change, make sure to create a new version directory incremental to the highest version available for that image. For example if there is a directory/version named `v1` for an image, a breaking change would mean creating a new version/directory namely `v2` within that image and a non-breaking change would just mean editing/updating some existing files for that image. 
- Once you are happy with the changes, you are ready to create a PR. Remember to test your changes first.
- Make sure to commit the modifications with a message that indicates the changes you've made. 
- Please remember to update the required READMEs when you make any changes.
